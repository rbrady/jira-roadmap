This project was created to provide a roadmap report that I wanted in Jira but
did not exist.  The roadmap report generated by this project provides answers
of what the team is focused on right now, what the team is planning to work on
and how close the team is to completing epics.

# This is a test comment for a PR

Jira Prerequisites
==================

At a minimum you will need a jira project and this project expects that you will
use Epics to plan your development.  Additionally, you may filter more specifically
within a project using labels.

A special label assumed to be in use is "long-term". When the "long-term" labels
are used on epics it will separately display information about them from regular
epics.  The long-term epics are used to track work that seems to never end, e.g.
Team Improvement, Documentation and Releases.

Installation
============
This project is still under active development (but usable).  As such, the 
current usage experience is by installing and running from source code.


    git clone https://github.com/rbrady/jira-roadmap.git
    cd jira-roadmap
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
